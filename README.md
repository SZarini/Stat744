In my opinion, the scatterplot shown below (Bose et al., 2018), is an example of a very good data visualization:

In this plot, age-length relationship of two different male morphs (guarder and sneaker) in low and high contaminant environments is clearly displayed. In terms of clear vision, the graph is well designed, and the reader can easily understand it. The only change I would have made could be choosing signs with different shapes (or more distinct coloration) for guarder and sneaker males to make it more distinguishable on the graph, especially because the data points are overlapping. However, the lines are clear enough and can easily show the existing pattern. Legends are accurate and informative which helps with understanding the graph. Scales are appropriate with an acceptable range, so the data points fill most of the graph area. There has been a very good strategy in making the figure, because a considerable amount of quantitative data is being clearly visualized in a relatively simple but informative way.
