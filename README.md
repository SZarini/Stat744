In my opinion, the scatterplot shown below (Bose et al., 2018), is an example of a very good data visualization:

In this plot, age-length relationship of two different male morphs (guarder and sneaker) in low and high contaminant environments is clearly displayed. In terms of clear vision, the graph is well designed, and the reader can easily understand it. The only change I would have made could be choosing signs with different shapes (or more distinct coloration) for guarder and sneaker males to make it more distinguishable on the graph, especially because the data points are overlapping. However, the lines are clear enough and can easily show the existing pattern. Legends are accurate and informative which helps with understanding the graph. Scales are appropriate with an acceptable range, so the data points fill most of the graph area. There has been a very good strategy in making the figure, because a considerable amount of quantitative data is being clearly visualized in a relatively simple but informative way.

**BMB**: I agree, I like the clean design of the figure. As mentioned in class, I would prefer a log *scale* to a log *transformation* here (and if not, the base of the log should be indicated).  The y-axis should have an English-language description (i.e. "log Standard length (L_s) (units?)").  Direct labeling could be used (if not, a legend should be used - the figure should always be as close to self-contained as possible).
  I am not 100% sure those bars are ± SD (how many? 1 SD?) and not 95% confidence intervals?  I would definitely prefer ± 2 SD or 95% CIs when possible, as readers may interpret them optimistically as 95% CIs ...
  The two lowest points in the high-contamination/sneaker category are a little surprising (i.e. don't agree very well with the regression line), I guess they're just dominated by lots of points in the larger ages?

mark: 2.5/3
